************************************ Dry language ***************************************

V 1.0

The language is written in python, compiled to c++ then ran. It's quite lacking performance-wise but who cares
im just having fun with it. i might decide to have it compiled to assembly but only time will tell...

VARIABLES::
    > variables work similar to c++
    > you can't declare variables without assigning it a value so... sorry
    > variables have data types which are as follows:
            >> num
            >> str
    > assign variables as so:
            >> num version -> 1;
            >> the first keyword is the data type. the second is the identifier 
            >> instead of an equals i use a "->"
            >>
            >> str text -> "dry++ is the best";
            >> thats quite true..
