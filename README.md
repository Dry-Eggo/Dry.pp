************************************ Dry++ Language ***************************************

Version 1.0

Welcome to Dry++, a fun and experimental programming language! This language is written in Python, compiled to C++, and then executed. While performance may not be its strongest suit, the goal here is to enjoy the process of coding and experimentation. Who knows? I might even explore compiling to assembly in the future, but that’s a story for another time!

VARIABLES:
Similar to C++:
Variables in Dry++ function similarly to those in C++. You’ll feel right at home if you’re familiar with C++ syntax!

Assignment Required:
You cannot declare a variable without assigning it a value. Sorry, not sorry!

Data Types:
Variables in Dry++ have specific data types, which are as follows:

num: Represents numerical values.
str: Represents string values.
Variable Assignment:
Assign variables using the following syntax:

plaintext
num version -> 1;
The first keyword indicates the data type.
The second part is the identifier (name of the variable).
Instead of using the traditional equals sign (=), Dry++ utilizes the arrow (->).
Example:

plaintext
str text -> "dry++ is the best";
And honestly, that statement holds true!
INPUT AND OUTPUT:
Output to Console: Use the out(value) function to display messages to the console:

plaintext
out("Hello, world!");
Input from User: Capture user input with the in(variable) function:

plaintext
in(userInput);
CONCLUSION:
Dry++ is designed for fun and experimentation, making it a great tool for those looking to play with programming concepts. Dive in, have a blast coding, and don’t hesitate to explore the possibilities!
